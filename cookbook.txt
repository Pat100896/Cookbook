CHOPSUEY

Chopsuey or Chop Suey is a dish made-up of meat (chicken or pork) and seafood (shrimp or fish) cooked 
with different kinds of vegetables.This dish is considered to be of Chinese origin but there are claims 
that Chopsuey is of American – Chinese origin that was made famous by Chinese immigrants in America.

In the Philippines, Chopsuey is a common dish and considered to be one of the top vegetable dishes. 
The local variation includes chicken liver, shrimp, and seasoned vegetables. I usually thicken the sauce 
of my Chopsuey to bring out its Chinese influence. Do you prefer it the same way? Let me know what you

ADOBO

This recipe requires the chicken slices to be marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, garlic, and whole peppercorn. 
The longer the chicken is marinated, the tastier it becomes because it can absorb more marinade. In my case, the 
bowl where I had chicken was covered and I kept it inside the refrigerator while marinating. This ensures me that 
the chicken stays fresh during the process and it also prevents contamination.

INGREDIENTS

•2 lbs. chicken thighs cut into serving pieces
•5 pieces hard boiled eggs
•2 cups chicken broth
•5 tablespoons dark soy sauce
•3 tablespoons vinegar
•6 to 8 cloves garlic, crushed
•1 tablespoon whole peppercorn
•4 pieces dried bay leaves
•Salt to taste (optional)
•3 tablespoons cooking oil

INSTRUCTIONS

1.Combine chicken, soy sauce, whole peppercorn, and half of the crushed garlic in a large bowl. 
  Mix well and ensure that the chicken gets coated with the marinade. Cover the bowl and marinate for at least 1 hour. 
  Note: the longer the time to marinate, the better.
2.Heat oil in a cooking pot
3.Add the remaining crushed garlic. Cook until the garlic starts to turn brown.
4.Add the marinated chicken including the marinade. Stir and cook for 3 minutes.
5.Pour the chicken broth into the pot. Let boil.
6.Add the bay leaves and pour the vinegar into the pot. Let boil. Stir and cover the pot. Continue to cook until the 
  chicken gets tender and the sauce reduces to your preference.
7.Add salt (only if needed) and then add the eggs. Stir and cook for 2 minutes more.
8.Transfer to a serving plate. Serve.
9.Share and enjoy!
